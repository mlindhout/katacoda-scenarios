Welcome to my short introduction to Docker for absolute newbees. I want to provide you with a guided environment in which you can play with Docker without have to install anything. Thanks to Katacode, you are up and running in seconds.

A note about the Katacoda: refreshing the page restarts your environment. So, if you're stuck, just hit refresh and start over again. If you accidentally hit refresh.... I'm sorry ;-)

Enjoy.
